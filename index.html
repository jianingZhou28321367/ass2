                The map above is used to show the distribution of the GHG-emission in the global. In this map, the
                depth of the map's color represents the amount of the GHG emissions, The darker the color, the more
                carbon dioxide emissions, and vice versa. In order to let us grasp more detail information about a
                specified country, the map would pop a window to show the amount of the GHG emission of the current
                country. From the map above, we could find that the regions with a large amount are China, US, Brazil,
                Russia, Australia and India, and so on.

                The chart above is used to show the top 10 countries in GHG-emissions from 1990 - 2018. From this chart
                above, we can know the top 10 countries with highest GHG emission from 1990 to 2018 are: Brazil, Canada,
                China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Rissia and United States, respectively. Especially, the
                growth rate of the top 3 countries are obviously increasing since the 1997.

                This chart above is mainly used to show the change in KgCO2 /GDP(per Million US Dollars) from 1990 - 2018.
                From this chart, it could know that in 1990 (orange dot), Indonesia, China and Russia had the highest value of GHG per GDP,
                expecially for Indonesia, they emitted 11.86 KGCO2 GHG when they produced 1 Million Dollars of GDP. But until 2018,
                These countries have improved greatly, and the top 10 countries in emissions are all working hard to reduce the data, 
                which means that they are moving in a good direction.
